Neural Network implementation

## How to use

- Dowload the three .py files and the database and make sure they are in the same folder.

- Open the DataTreatment.py file.

- You can directly change the parameters in the last line in order to run some tests (training, prediction and evolution of the error). See the *full_test* docstring or type *help(full_test)* for further information.

- You can create a neural network using *NeuralNetwork(format, input_size)*. Use *help(NeuralNetwork)* for further information.
S
- You can use any database you want, as long as it has float values. Just make sure that the last layer of the network has as many neurons as groups (K = 2 for the spam database).
